## School Project Details

- **Role:** Database Designer
- **Tools:** MySQL Workbench, MySQL, Lucidchart
- **Duration:** February 2023 - May 2023

## Project Overview

### Client

Community Based Organization (CBO) is a non-profit organization operating at the local level, primarily focusing on addressing the needs and concerns of specific communities or groups. In the realm of public schools, these organizations play a crucial role in supporting and supplementing educational initiatives. Common activities include after-school programs, parental involvement, cultural and art programs, among others.

### Challenge

The project aimed to address the existing challenges in managing student databases in public schools. The data was scattered across multiple spreadsheets, making it cumbersome to retrieve, edit, or update accurately. The objective was to develop an efficient and user-friendly solution that enhances school operations, eliminating inconsistencies and errors.

### Solution

The proposed solution involved the creation of a comprehensive database, providing a centralized platform for managing student information, attendance, classes, and grades. To ensure the security of sensitive student information, the database utilized anonymized data.
